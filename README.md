# CoSys Work

CoSys or Collaborative Systems are systems built to be composed together for various collaborative needs. Collaborative document editing and project management is under the CurEdit project, which serves as a kernel for a lot of CoSys compositions.

# NB
1. We use `pnpm` as the package manager. 
  - Please use `ng config -g cli.packageManager pnpm` (or without the global flag) to configure your CLI.
  - Please use `pnx` instead of `nx` in the monorepo. In your shell config add `alias pnx="pnpm run nx --"`
